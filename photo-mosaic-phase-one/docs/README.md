# Photo mosaic
*A fundraising/donation platform where users pay to unlock pieces of your pictures as a photo mosaic.*

##Idea
The basic idea is that somebody has a photo they are proud of. Our platform would offer a way of selling that photo.
It would be split up in many little parts as a mosaic and at the beginning it would be completely black. Users of our platform
could then click on one piece of the picture and pay money in order to "unlock" that piece.
It can be used for donations for charities, promotion of products by showing limited art on this site, kickstarting your
product, ...

##MVP
1. Anybody can register using Google/Facebook authentication
2. Users must connect using an online payment service provider (eg. Paypal, Scrill, others)
3. Users must be able to introduce their project and post news.
4. The project can have one or more mosaics that are shown on the project home page
5. Any registered user with a connected PSP can pay to unlock pieces of mosaics
6. Any registered user can comment and like photos and news
7. The platform must offer an admin access to the site. Users in admin view can:
  1. Upload images used for mosaics
  2. Check payments
  3. Unlock pieces of the picture

##Target audience
This platform is meant for people who need donations, want to promote their products, or simply students who work on a passion 
project and want to develop it into something more.

##Supported devices
The initial goal is to get this platform supported on personal computers.
After that is implemented, we will try to expand to mobile devices.

##Ideas for expansion of product
1. User selects how in many pieces the picture is sliced
2. Options to unlock pieces of pictures:
  1. A set goal that has to be reached
  2. A set timer that has to be reached
  3. When the user feels like it (in order to stimulate sales of other pieces)
3. Expansion to mobile devices
4. Instead of only pictures you can unlock other content too
  1. Video content  You just see a thumbnail mosaic until you unlock all pieces
  2. Music - You can only play snippets of songs
  3. Text - Sections of text can be blocked, unlocked only by donations
5. Bonuses can be given to users who donate a set amount of money (defined by author of project)
